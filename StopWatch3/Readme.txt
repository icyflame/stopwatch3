STOPWATCH 3.0

This software implements a simple lap stopwatch. The timings that are generated are then stored inside a file called the 
'timings.txt' file which is in the same folder as the executable and the other zip files.

This release comes with additional features that include showing the stopwatch run as in most modern stopwatches.

This application was written by Siddharth Kannan on Python 2.7 and Tkinter 8.5 on a machine running Windows XP SP 3.
